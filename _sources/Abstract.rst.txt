Abstract
========

In recent years, quad-rotor UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) technology has taken off in the research and commercial realm, and allowed for new possibilities in ISR (Imaging, Recovery and Surveillance) with civilian and military applications. Development of robust inner and outer-loop control strategies on these platforms has thus been an important research topic. Additionally, development of hardware solutions that efficiently package the increasing variety of computational platforms in a space, weight and power-saving manner has been paramount in order to ensure longer flight times and achieve more complex missions. The scope of this project has thus been to develop mechanical and electronic hardware and firmware improvements in order to create a quadcopter optimized for image-processing tasks. A dual-brain control architecture has been developed in order to segment the "inner-loop" hard-realtime tasks involving vehicle guidance, navigation and control (GNC), and "outer-loop" control involving mission planning, debugging, image processing and vision-driven navigation decision generation and trajectory generation.
